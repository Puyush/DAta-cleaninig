# FIFA-21 Data Cleaning Challenge

Data Cleaning And Analysis Using Python.

Why Data Cleaning:

As the world increasingly relies on data, the importance of data cleaning has never been more apparent. Suppose you’re a football coach preparing for an upcoming game against a rival team. You’ve spent hours analyzing data on your team’s performance and your opponent’s strengths and weaknesses. but you realize that there are errors and inconsistencies throughout the data set. As you clean the data, you start to see patterns and on that, you decide to focus on your game plan that leads to victory against your rival team.

Essential Steps for Data Cleaning And Analysis:

1) Import Necessary Libraries like Numpy, Panda, Matplotlib, etc.
2) Load the Dataset.
3) Handling Missing Values.
4) Removing Duplicates and Dropping Irrelevant Features.
5) Handling Outliers.
6) Visualize Dataset.

Conclusion:

Data cleaning may seem tedious and time-consuming, but it is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of your data. Following best practices such as identifying outliers, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats can transform messy, incomplete data into valuable insights that inform important decisions.

Important Note: A file having a description of features for the dataset is also uploaded.
